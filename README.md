# TI-Basic Cryptography Functions
> A collection of helper programs with basic cryptopgraphy operations written in TI-Basic

## Installation
1. Download Texas Instruments's [**TI-Connect**](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw), their IDE for Basic projects.
2. Use a mini-usb cable to connect your computer to the port on calculator and upload files
3. Run on the calculator
> I've tested these on a TI-84 Plus CE, but these should work on any calculator in the TI-84 family

## Features
